You decided to visit local Tavern. Ugly singboard and there will be dirty inside for sure.
You are hungry so you go straight to the bar. You order beer and  plate of something you just don't want to ask of.
Pay one piece of gold.
With lighter purse you can leave Tavern or stay and meet some very interesting people.
In dark corner of Tavern there is sitting this strange guy. Came from nowhere, noone knows his name. Great company for you.
"If you need a weapon, I have a great deal for you"
"Go to the Cementary and defeat Crying Lady Ghost."
